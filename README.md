# Personal Portfolio Website – Solution Approach <br>
## Overview <br>
This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer.<br>
The goal was to build a responsive, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing website that highlights key areas such as my biography, skills, projects, and contact information.<br>

## Project Structure<br>
HTML5: Provides the semantic structure of the site.<br>

CSS3: Styles the content, manages layouts, and controls responsiveness.<br>

JavaScript: Adds interactivity, including typing animations and counters.<br>

Assets: Includes images, icons, and downloadable resources like my CV.<br>

## Key Features Implemented<br>
### Header Section with Typing Animation<br>

On page load, the heading (h1) and sub-heading (h2) are animated to type out character-by-character for a dynamic introduction.<br>

### Navigation Menu<br>

A clean, centered menu with flexbox that smoothly transitions on hover.<br>

Menu links have hover effects, including background color changes and slight scaling for a modern UI feel.<br>

Buttons ("Hire Me" and "Download CV") are styled separately for easy visibility and action.<br>

### Responsive Grid for Project Cards<br>

Projects are displayed in a 3-column responsive grid.<br>

Each project card is a perfect square.<br>

Hovering over a card reveals the project name and description with a dark overlay, maintaining readability without losing the background image.<br>

### Smooth Scroll and Counter Animation<br>

Numeric statistics (e.g., Finished Projects, Working Hours) animate from 0 to their value when the user scrolls to the section.<br>

### Background Images<br>

Hero and Contact sections use full-width background images.<br>

Backgrounds are set to cover and center for optimal appearance across different devices without cutting off important parts.<br>

### Responsive Design<br>

Media queries ensure the layout adjusts smoothly on smaller screens (like tablets and phones).<br>

The grid structure stacks vertically on smaller viewports.<br>

Font sizes and spacing are adjusted for mobile readability.<br>

### Modern UI/UX Elements<br>

Use of hover animations, transitions, and light visual effects like scaling and glowing buttons to make the site feel more lively and interactive.<br>

### Technologies Used<br>
HTML5 – for semantic structure<br>

CSS3 – for styling, transitions, and responsive layout<br>

JavaScript (Vanilla) – for typing effects, counter animations, and interaction control<br>

Flexbox and CSS Grid – for layout management<br>

### Future Improvements<br>
Add a Dark Mode toggle.<br>

Integrate scroll animations for section reveals (using libraries like AOS.js).<br>

Add a contact form with email functionality (using Formspree or a backend service).<br>

Include live project previews (demos) along with GitHub links.<br>

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).<br>

### How to Run the Project<br>
Clone or download the project files.<br>

Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).<br>

Ensure that the addons/ folder contains the necessary images and downloadable assets (e.g., CV PDF).<br>

No additional server setup is required; it's a pure static site.<br>
